    <p><strong>Segmenting Emotional Episodes:</strong> Currently working on the problem of segmenting and classifying emotional episodes in conversations. In a call center conversation, a client might be angry at some point of the conversation and perhaps after certain time he/she might be happy or shows satisfactory expressions. In my research, I am trying to automatically segment these temporal emotional phenomena using machine-learning approaches.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Conversation Summarization:</strong> We are working on summarizing conversations in terms of emotion, topic and sentiment by utilizing NLP and Machine Learning techniques from speech and social media. Conversation summarization is a part of European Union funded project aimed to advance the next-generation analytics technology (http://www.sensei-conversation.eu).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Affective Behavioral Signals Recognition Systems:</strong> Designed and developed emotion recognizer as a part of emotion analytics system. Our study mainly focused on understanding whether the agent is empathic or not while client is angry or frustrated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Personality Trait Recognition Systems:</strong> Designed and developed Personality Trait Recognition Systems in domains such as broad-cast news, human-human conversation and social-media (i.e., facebook, youtube) by utilizing acoustic, linguistic and psycholinguistic information with machine learning algorithms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open Source Tools (e.g., Personality traits scorer, LOSO-split, LIWC-web-client using Java and Python).</p>
