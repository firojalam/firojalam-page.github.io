**Research Associate,** [Qatar Computing Research Institute](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fqcri.com&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG4NN8h2FDl7NDtAGESvjl8zF-igQ), Qatar, Sept-2016 to Jan - 2018

\- Developed Image Processing Pipeline into AIDR system

**PhD Research** , [SIS Lab](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsisl.disi.unitn.it&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFKyKv-3r9CIOvSHbg_ZC8Oanwzhw), [University of Trento](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fict.unitn.it&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF4sdgmPg8lxsT7wKTcG2RjUYR5ZQ), Italy. Nov-2011 to Dec-2016.

*   **Segmenting Emotional Episodes:** Currently working on the problem of segmenting and classifying emotional episodes in conversations. In a call center conversation, a client might be angry at some point of the conversation and perhaps after certain time he/she might be happy or shows satisfactory expressions. In my research, I am trying to automatically segment these temporal emotional phenomena using machine-learning approaches.
    
*   **Conversation Summarization:** We are working on summarizing conversations in terms of emotion, topic and sentiment by utilizing NLP and Machine Learning techniques from speech and social media. Conversation summarization is a part of European Union funded project aimed to advance the next-generation analytics technology (http://www.sensei-conversation.eu).
    
*   **Affective Behavioral Signals Recognition Systems:** Designed and developed emotion recognizer as a part of emotion analytics system. Our study mainly focused on understanding whether the agent is empathic or not while client is angry or frustrated.
    
*   **Personality Trait Recognition Systems:** Designed and developed Personality Trait Recognition Systems in domains such as broad-cast news, human-human conversation and social-media (i.e., facebook, youtube) by utilizing acoustic, linguistic and psycholinguistic information with machine learning algorithms.
    
*   Open Source Tools (e.g., Personality traits scorer, LOSO-split, LIWC-web-client using Java and Python).
    
*   **Research Intern**, [HLT Unit](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fhlt.fbk.eu&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEknR0bb3MocmSIdiNoFWhJkl-pdQ), [Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK-irst)](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fbk.eu&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEEh3CKs9CmnCuRCc50F3h79DZHuw), Trento, Italy. June 2011 – October 2011.
    
*   **Designed** Named Entity Recognition System for broadcast news transcription, which also works for newspaper text.
    
*   **Participated** in the Evalita-2011 evaluation campaign where my work **ranked as a best system**.
    

**Research Fellow**, Center for Research on Bangla Language Processing (CRBLP), Department of Computer Science and Engineering, BRAC University. September 2010 to September 2012.

*   **Coordinated** with CRBLP members to develop unit selection based Bangla TTS system.
    

**Research Programmer**, Center for Research on Bangla Language Processing (CRBLP), Department of Computer Science and Engineering, BRAC University. September 2006 to July 2010.

*   **Developed** the first [Bangla Text to Speech system](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fblp%2Ffiles%2FKatha_Bangla_TTS%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFPqLA2w0yZILnMMKONqijJ10DCQQ).
    
*   **Contributed to other** [**projects**](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ffaculty.bracu.ac.bd%2F~firoj%2F%23researchproject&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF6PbHpqYY_ElIg6ApJMfIlt4zdEQ): Pronunciation dictionary, Wordnet, Lexicon, Speech Corpora, etc. Most of these projects were funded by [International Development Research Center (IDRC)](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fidrc.ca%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGU2H1CZpe884pJLTBRSqzgfxicsg) of Canada under its [PAN Localization Network (PanL10n)](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpanl10n.net%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEj_W8W7ZIYJS2XB98nnLGo-o0aHA) program.
