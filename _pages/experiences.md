## [Research/Professional Experience](#research-professional-experience)

**Scientist,** [Qatar Computing Research Institute](https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/qcri), Qatar, Oct-2019 to Present

*   Disinformation in Social Media (http://tanbih.qcri.org)
    

**Post-Doctoral Researcher,** [Qatar Computing Research Institute](https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/qcri), Qatar, Feb-2018 to Sept-2019

*   CrisisDPS (http://crisisdps.qcri.org/)
    
*   Responsible for AIDR (http://aidr.qcri.org) system development and maintenance
    
*   Exploring domain adaptation techniques using deep learning
    
*   Investigating how multimodality (text and image) can help in crisis computing
    

**Research Associate,** [Qatar Computing Research Institute](https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/qcri), Qatar, Sept-2016 to Jan - 2018

\- Developed Image Processing Pipeline into AIDR system

**PhD Research** , [SIS Lab](http://sisl.disi.unitn.it/), [University of Trento](https://ict.unitn.it/), Italy. Nov-2011 to Dec-2016.

*   **Segmenting Emotional Episodes:** Currently working on the problem of segmenting and classifying emotional episodes in conversations. In a call center conversation, a client might be angry at some point of the conversation and perhaps after certain time he/she might be happy or shows satisfactory expressions. In my research, I am trying to automatically segment these temporal emotional phenomena using machine-learning approaches.
    
*   **Conversation Summarization:** We are working on summarizing conversations in terms of emotion, topic and sentiment by utilizing NLP and Machine Learning techniques from speech and social media. Conversation summarization is a part of European Union funded project aimed to advance the next-generation analytics technology (http://www.sensei-conversation.eu).
    
*   **Affective Behavioral Signals Recognition Systems:** Designed and developed emotion recognizer as a part of emotion analytics system. Our study mainly focused on understanding whether the agent is empathic or not while client is angry or frustrated.
    
*   **Personality Trait Recognition Systems:** Designed and developed Personality Trait Recognition Systems in domains such as broad-cast news, human-human conversation and social-media (i.e., facebook, youtube) by utilizing acoustic, linguistic and psycholinguistic information with machine learning algorithms.
    
*   Open Source Tools (e.g., Personality traits scorer, LOSO-split, LIWC-web-client using Java and Python).
    
*   **Research Intern**, [HLT Unit](https://hlt.fbk.eu/), [Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK-irst)](https://www.fbk.eu/en/), Trento, Italy. June 2011 – October 2011.
    
*   **Designed** Named Entity Recognition System for broadcast news transcription, which also works for newspaper text.
    
*   **Participated** in the Evalita-2011 evaluation campaign where my work **ranked as a best system**.
    

**Research Fellow**, Center for Research on Bangla Language Processing (CRBLP), Department of Computer Science and Engineering, BRAC University. September 2010 to September 2012.

*   **Coordinated** with CRBLP members to develop unit selection based Bangla TTS system.
    

**Research Programmer**, Center for Research on Bangla Language Processing (CRBLP), Department of Computer Science and Engineering, BRAC University. September 2006 to July 2010.

*   **Developed** the first [Bangla Text to Speech system](https://sourceforge.net/projects/blp/files/Katha_Bangla_TTS/).
    
*   **Contributed to other** [**projects**](http://faculty.bracu.ac.bd/~firoj/#researchproject): Pronunciation dictionary, Wordnet, Lexicon, Speech Corpora, etc. Most of these projects were funded by [International Development Research Center (IDRC)](https://idrc.ca/en) of Canada under its [PAN Localization Network (PanL10n)](https://panl10n.net/) program.
    
*   **Contributed** to the Microsoft localization (Windows-Vista and Office-2007 interface) project.
