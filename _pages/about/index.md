My contributions go to the development of AI systems in the field of Fake news/Disinformation ...

**Research Interests:**

*   **Machine Learning/Deep Learning:** Classical Algorithms (e.g., SVM, RF) to Deep Neural Network to solve supervised and semi-supervised problems.
    
*   **Applicative Contexts:** Natural Language Processing, Behavioral and Social Signal Processing (Emotion, Personality traits) from Speech and Text; Social Media Text Analysis.

**Short Bio:** Currently working for QCRI, Qatar, as a Scientist. 
I received my PhD in Computer Science from the [University of Trento](https://ict.unitn.it/), under the supervision of [Prof. Giuseppe Riccardi](http://sisl.disi.unitn.it/team-member/giuseppe-riccardi/), master's from the same department, and undergrad from [BRAC University](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/).

The Design of Computational models for Analyzing Personality and Affective Behavioral Signals (particular focus on empathy) from speech and text

*   "Who expresses what emotional state when?",
    
*   Conversation summarization with behavoiral descriptions in terms of emotion, topic and sentiment by utilizing NLP and Machine Learning techniques from spoken conversations and social media data. [www.sensei-conversation.eu](http://www.sensei-conversation.eu/)
